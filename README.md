## REPL
[Babel](http://babeljs.io/), a [Node](https://nodejs.org/) [transpiler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source-to-source_compiler) for ES6, has an online [REPL](http://babeljs.io/repl/).

## Reading
The [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) site has a section on [learning ES6](https://www.babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6). It's based on Luke Hoban's [es6-features GitHub repo](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features#readme).

Confusingly, there is also a website [es-6-features.org](http://es6-features.org/), with an accompanying [GitHub repo](https://github.com/rse/es6-features).

Leanpub has two books that are free to read online.

- [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read/), by [Nicholas Zakas](http://www.nczonline.net/)
- [Exploring ES6](https://leanpub.com/exploring-es6/read), by [Axel Rauschmayer](http://rauschma.de/)
